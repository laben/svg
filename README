This is a Perl 6 module that makes it easy to write Scalable Vector Graphic
files, short SVG.

Right now it is a shallow wrapper around XML::Writer, adding only the xmlns
attributes that identifies an XML file as SVG. More SVG specific features are
planned.

For building an running the tests, we recommend to obtain 'ufo' from
http://github.com/masak/ufo/ and then run

    $ ufo
    $ make
    $ make test # recommended
    $ make install # if you like it
